# Vending Machine Tracker
​
We're developing an application to track vending machines across the city. This will test your ability to set up and test many-to-many relationships and access attributes and methods through those relationships.
​
* Vending machines may be stocked with different snacks, 
* and the same snack may be available at many different places throughout the city. 
Before you begin: what does that mean the relationship is between vending machines and snacks? How many snacks does a vending machine have? How many vending machines can a snack be in?
